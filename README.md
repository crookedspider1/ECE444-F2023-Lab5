# Pros of TDD
- Promotes more modular design since you are focused on smaller testable features.
- Your code will be easier to maintain and refactor in the future because you have a comprehensive set of tests to ensure that the project is still functioning.
- You will have more tests to give you confidence that your project will actually work.
- Forces you to document how the code should be used and the expected behaviour. You cant really write tests properly without doing this, but its possible to write documentation that doesnt fully describe that.

# Cons of TDD
- TDD doesnt guarantee you wont encounter bugs. You could create tests with bugs in them, and you could also just not create tests for the cases that break your code. Perhaps you have an issue with a very specific number, perhaps your code fails after receiving enough requests. There are plenty of issues that you might just not pick up.
- It requires the collaboration of the entire team, otherwise it loses value. Testing is only as strong as your weakest link, and if one member doesnt keep up, your tests might not be sufficient.
